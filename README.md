**What is an access control system?**
>
System that helps you monitor the access to some important places from your office or house. The Access Control System will give you posibilty to control and restrict all the entrances and exits which happens in your building.

**Advantages of an Access Control System**
1. **Track each entry and exit**
Access Control systems log each access made through a door, and track who entered or left the building. This enables you to backtrack all the activities that take place in your facility as well as monitor time and attendance throughout the organization.
2. **Restrictions and Privileges**
With an Access Control System in place, you can control who enters the building, and when. Employees who are not allowed post a certain period cannot exceed their stay or enter the premises post their shift, and janitorial staff who work night shifts can only access the facility at night.
3. **Remote Access Control**
Access Control Systems are remotely accessible, which means they can be controlled or monitored from a remote location, and are only available for a handful of staff members or the security team.
